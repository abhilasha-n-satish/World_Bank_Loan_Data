## Module 1
### Task 1: Data Import and Initial Exploration

In data analysis, the initial step of importing a dataset and exploring its initial content is akin to opening a door to valuable insights. This is essential because it allows us to ensure we have the right data foundation for uncovering key information and patterns in the context of our project.

``` Python
#--- Import Pandas ---
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv( './data_worldbank.csv')

#--- Inspect data ---
df
```

### Task 2: Identifying Duplicate Data

In this step, we aim to identify and quantify the presence of duplicate data within our dataset. The count of duplicates (referred to as 'duplicates' in the code) is an important metric. It helps us understand the extent of redundancy in our dataset, which is crucial for data quality and accuracy in our analysis. By recognizing and handling duplicate records, we ensure that our insights and conclusions are based on unique, meaningful data, preventing any potential distortions caused by repeated entries.

``` Python
duplicates = df.duplicated().sum()

#--- Inspect data ---
df
```

### Task 3: Removing Duplicate Data

In this step, we are removing duplicate data from our dataset by utilizing the drop_duplicates function with the inplace=True parameter. Duplicate data can introduce noise and inaccuracies into our analysis, and removing them ensures that we work with unique and non-repetitive records. This process improves the quality and reliability of our data, setting the stage for more accurate and meaningful insights.

``` Python
#df = ...
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

#--- Inspect data ---
df
```

### Task 4: Identifying Missing Data

Here, we're examining our dataset for missing values, indicated by 'null' values. The 'null_values' variable holds the count of missing data points for each column. Identifying and quantifying missing data is crucial as it helps us understand the completeness of our dataset. Dealing with missing values appropriately is essential for accurate analysis and decision-making. By knowing the extent of missing data, we can take measures to handle them effectively and ensure the reliability of our results.

``` Python
null_values = df.isnull().sum()

#--- Inspect data ---
df
```

### Task 5: Handling Missing Data

In this step, we're addressing missing data in specific columns, namely 'Board Approval Date' and 'Effective Date (Most Recent).' We use the dropna function with the subset parameter to remove rows with missing values in these columns, setting inplace=True. Handling missing data is crucial to maintain data integrity and accuracy in our analysis. By removing rows with missing values in these specific columns, we ensure that the dataset remains reliable and complete for our subsequent analysis.

``` Python
#df = ...
df.dropna(subset=['Board Approval Date', 'Effective Date (Most Recent)'], inplace=True)

#--- Inspect data ---
df
```

### Task 6: Data Preparation and Column Transformation

In this step, we are preparing the dataset for analysis. We remove unnecessary columns and rename some columns to improve clarity and consistency. This ensures that the dataset is optimized for our analysis, making it more concise and easier to work with in the next stages of our project.

``` Python
#df = ...
#remove specific columns
columns_to_remove = ["Country Code", "Borrower's Obligation (US$)"]
df.drop(columns=columns_to_remove, axis=1, inplace=True)

#rename columns
new_columns = {
    'Original Principal Amount (US$)': 'Original Principal Amount',
    'Undisbursed Amount (US$)': 'Undisbursed Amount',
    'Disbursed Amount (US$)': 'Disbursed Amount',
    'Repaid to IDA (US$)': 'Repaid to IDA',
    'Due to IDA (US$)': 'Due to IDA',
    'Cancelled Amount (US$)': 'Cancelled Amount',
    'Effective Date (Most Recent)': 'Effective Date'
}
df.rename(columns=new_columns, inplace=True)

#--- Inspect data ---
df
```

### Task 7: Data Conversion and Export

In this step, we are converting date columns to the appropriate datetime format. This is essential for accurate date-based analysis. After the conversion, we export the cleaned dataset to a CSV file for future use and verify the data types to ensure they are in the correct format.

``` Python
#--- Export the df as "cleaned_dataset.csv" ---
# Convert columns to datetime
df['Board Approval Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Board Approval Date'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
df['Effective Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Effective Date'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
df['End of Period'] = pd.to_datetime(df['End of Period'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')

# Save DataFrame to CSV
#df.to_csv('cleaned_dataset.csv', index=False)

# Check data types after conversion
dtypes_after_conversion = df.dtypes

#--- Inspect data ---
df
```

## Module 2
### Task 1: Data Download, Import, and Database Connection

##### -- Load the sql extention ----
``` SQL
%reload_ext sql
```

##### --- Load your mysql db using credentials from the "DB" area ---
``` SQL
%sql mysql+pymysql://bfa35d03:Cab#22se@localhost/bfa35d03
```
